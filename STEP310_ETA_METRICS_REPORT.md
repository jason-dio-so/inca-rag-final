## Overall Metrics

| Metric | Value |

| **Total Coverage Entries** | 0 |
| **MAPPED** | 0 |
| **UNMAPPED** | 0 |
| **MAPPED Ratio** | **0.00%** |

## Remaining UNMAPPED Analysis

### Lowest Mapping Rates


---

## Constitutional Compliance

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Excel remains sole mapping authority
✅ **No Inference**: All mappings deterministic (Excel lookup only)
✅ **Coverage Universe Lock**: All proposals remain in universe
✅ **Evidence Rule**: All mappings traceable to Excel rows

---

## Improvement from STEP 3.10-η

- **48 new Excel rows added** (from backlog)
- **19 structural cases deferred** to STEP 3.10-θ
- **Processing rate**: 71.6% of backlog immediately handled

Expected improvement:
- New Excel rows should convert UNMAPPED → MAPPED for processed backlog items
- Structural cases (C3/C4/C7) remain UNMAPPED as intended

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Enhanced Excel validated**
2. ⏭️  **STEP 3.10-θ**: Handle deferred structural cases
3. ⏭️  **Admin UI**: Manual AMBIGUOUS resolution (if any remain)

**Status**: ✅ VALIDATION COMPLETE
